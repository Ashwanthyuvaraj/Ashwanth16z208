DEPâ€™s 6,000 employees are dedicated to protecting public health and the environment by supplying clean drinking water, collecting and treating wastewater, and reducing air, noise, and hazardous material pollution. The scale of our organization is unmatched by any other water utility in the nation â€“ each day, DEP delivers one billion gallons of high quality drinking water a day to more than nine million New Yorkers and collects and treats an average of 1.3 billion gallons of wastewater at 14 wastewater treatment plants. As a result of DEPâ€™s investments in our wastewater treatment system, the New York Harbor is the cleanest it has been in more than a century. To support these functions, DEP has one of the largest capital construction portfolios in the City, with $11 billion of work under construction and an additional $3 billion in design.

The Deputy Commissioner will work collaboratively with the executive team to develop and implement innovative solutions to more effectively manage storm water, protect critical infrastructure from sea level rise, and address the other challenges posed by climate change.  DEP is one of the largest users of energy in the City.  The Deputy Commissioner will be responsible for realizing substantial reductions in energy consumption by employing innovative processes including the reuse of methane gas.

The Deputy Commissioner will also be responsible for working with three other major DEP operating bureaus (Water Supply, Water & Sewer Operations, and Engineering Design and Construction) to ensure that DEP optimizes its resources and impact through internal collaboration and strategic planning. The Deputy Commissioner must also be effective in working with consultants, City agencies and executives, and other external stakeholders to ensure that all Bureau of Wastewater Treatment programs are understood and effectively implemented.   The Deputy Commissioner position requires excellent leadership, communication, and presentation skills as well as passion for driving innovation, continuous improvement and efficiency, and implementing workforce strategies to recruit, develop, and retain the most qualified and diverse talent in wastewater operations nationwide.

The scale of our organization is unmatched by any other water utility in the nation â€“ each day, DEP delivers one billion gallons of high quality drinking water a day to more than nine million New Yorkers and collects and treats an average of 1.3 billion gallons of wastewater at 14 wastewater treatment plants. As a result of DEPâ€™s investments in our wastewater treatment system, the New York Harbor is the cleanest it has been in more than a century. To support these functions, DEP has one of the largest capital construction portfolios in the City, with $11 billion of work under construction and an additional $3 billion in design.  Reporting to the Commissioner, the Deputy Commissioner will provide leadership and policy direction for the largest of DEPâ€™s bureaus, with an annual operating budget of $387 million and 1,800 employees. The bureauâ€™s robust infrastructure includes 14 wastewater treatment plants, eight sludge dewatering facilities, 96 wastewater pumping stations, five wastewater and three microbiology laboratories, and related facilities and marine vessels for transporting sludge and monitoring waterways.   The Bureau of Wastewater Treatment is led by the Deputy Commissioner with two supporting Assistant Commissioners. The bureau consists of the following divisions:  â€¢	Plant Operations  â€¢	Collections & Residuals Management  â€¢	Engineering & Budget  â€¢	Capital Planning & Asset Management  â€¢	Regulatory Compliance & Administration  â€¢	Environmental Health & Safety   The Deputy Commissioner will be responsible for leading continuous improvements in wastewater operations and sustaining DEPâ€™s national reputation within the industry for innovation, excellence, and safety. Maintaining the system in a state of good repair and planning future upgrades will be of tremendous importance in this role. The Deputy Commissioner will work collaboratively with the executive team to develop and implement innovative solutions to more effectively manage storm water, protect critical infrastructure from sea level rise, and address the other challenges posed by climate change.  DEP is one of the largest users of energy in the City.  The Deputy Commissioner will be responsible for realizing substantial reductions in energy consumption by employing innovative processes including the reuse of methane gas.   In addition, the Deputy Commissioner will be responsible for making final recommendations to the Commissioner concerning extremely complex, technical, and often controversial programs concerning Federal and State water-quality based programs and permits and for:  â€¢	directing and tracking the Bureau's budget and expenditures;  â€¢	developing alternative solutions to providing wastewater treatment service; â€¢	representing DEP at public meetings where facilities and service issues are addressed; â€¢	establishing policies and procedures;  â€¢	coaching and evaluating management personnel; and,  â€¢	directing the preparation of statistical and narrative reports including the Annual New York Harbor Water Quality Survey and Discharge Monitoring Reports for submission to City, State, and Federal agencies to comply with regulatory requirements.  The Deputy Commissioner will also be responsible for working with three other major DEP operating bureaus (Water Supply, Water & Sewer Operations, and Engineering Design and Construction) to ensure that DEP optimizes its resources and impact through internal collaboration and strategic planning. The Deputy Commissioner must also be effective in working with consultants, City agencies and executives, and other external stakeholders to ensure that all Bureau of Wastewater Treatment programs are understood and effectively implemented.   The Deputy Commissioner position requires excellent leadership, communication, and presentation skills as well as passion for driving innovation, continuous improvement and efficiency, and implementing workforce strategies to recruit, develop, and retain the most qualified and diverse talent in wastewater operations nationwide.  This position requires leadership and visibility nationally in promoting industry best practices and collaborating with industry peers and associations.","A valid New York State License as a Professional Engineer is required.
